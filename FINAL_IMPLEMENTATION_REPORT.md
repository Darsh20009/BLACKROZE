## 🎓 FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

### To Write Tests (Next Step)

1. **Setup Jest/Vitest** (if not already)
2. **Test Recipe Engine**:
   ```typescript
   describe("RecipeEngine", () => {
     test("creates recipe with correct cost", async () => {
       const result = await RecipeEngine.createRecipe(...);
       expect(result.recipe.totalCost).toBe(expected);
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Test Inventory Engine**:
   ```typescript
   describe("InventoryEngine", () => {
     test("prevents negative stock", async () => {
       const result = await InventoryEngine.deductFromOrder(...);
       expect(result.success).toBe(true);
     });
   });
   ```

4. **Test Accounting Engine**:
   ```typescript
   describe("AccountingEngine", () => {
     test("calculates daily snapshot correctly", async () => {
       const snapshot = await AccountingEngine.getDailySnapshot(...);
       expect(snapshot.totalProfit).toBe(expected);
     });
   });
   ```

5. **Test API Routes**: Use supertest for HTTP tests

6. **Test UI Components**: Use React Testing Library

### What Tests Should Cover
- [ ] Happy path (normal operations)
- [ ] Edge cases (zero values, limits)
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs)
- [ ] Data validation (required fields)
- [ ] Authorization checks
- [ ] API responses
- [ ] UI interactions
- [ ] Export generation
